# CAC-Project---ParkingPro-
My project for the Congressional App Challenge; ParkingPro

ParkingPro is an application that tells where you parked your car, all from your phone. It doesn't require any tracking devices, or car monitering systems to function - It is all AI based. 
Unlike other car finding tools, you don't need to take the time to save your car's location manually. Everything is done automatically!
