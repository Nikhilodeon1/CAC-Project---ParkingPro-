# CAC-Project---ParkingPro-
My project for the Congressional App Challenge; ParkingPro

ParkingPro is an application that tells where you parked your car, all from your phone. It doesn't require any tracking devices, or car monitering systems to function - It is all AI based. 
Unlike other car finding tools, you don't need to take the time to save your car's location manually. Everything is done automatically!

Another perk of using ParkingPro is that none of your data/location history is stored in the cloud or in a server. All your information is stored on your computer, and you can clear that data whenever you want
